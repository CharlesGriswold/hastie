  <h2> Introductions, Blessings and Giving Thanks! </h2>
  <div class="meta">Date: Sun, Dec 12, 2009</div>
  
  <p>Marcus&#39; brother and family came out from Washington D.C. for the baptism of their daughter Kasia and Thanksgiving. It was the first time Danelle met the whole family, his wife Amada and Marcus&#39; godson Aleksander. The baptism was beautiful, Mike is the Godfather for Kasia and Mom was standing in for Amada&#39;s sister as Godmother.</p>

<p><strong>For</strong> Thanksgiving Marcus made a delicious pumpkin soup and a skillet apple pie, I prepared a green bean casserole. All the food was scrumptious and Marcus&#39; dessert was a hit! We enjoyed the time with the family and have so much to be thankful for this year. Peace and love this holiday season!</p>
